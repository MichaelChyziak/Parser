Parser
======
Hello ENSC 251 classmates. If you wish to use our code feel free (giving proper credit at the top of you files ofcourse). If for some reason you find a test case that the TA's didn't find and that NEEDS to be covered then please let us know on piazza and we will fix the code accordingly ASAP. We are the afternoon lab on tuesday and since we don't have any lab for questions to be asked, feel free to ask them on piazza also.

Cases Failed:
-----
stressTestB.cpp gives out 275 tokens instead of the posted 272 tokens, but another group has also gotten 275 so waiting on confirmation. However this is only the optional stress test and every other case both needed and optional was passed.

How to access the code:
-----
All you need is the "parserClasses.cpp" and "parserClasses.h" file to continue on with assignment 3. In order to copy the code just click one of them and right above the code on the right side should be a button labeled "Raw". Click on that button and then copy and paste the code for use in assignment 3. Good Luck.
