Hello ENSC 251 classmates. Our code has passed all of the cases except for stressTestB.cpp. It seems although that some people are also not getting the correct amount of tokens so it may be that the number given was wrong. Anyhow that is irrelevant as the stressTestB.cpp is bonus and does not require to work.
If anybody would like to use our code feel free (giving proper credit at the top of you files ofcourse). If for some reason you find a test case that the TA's didn't find and that NEEDS to be covered then please let us know on piazza and we will fix the code accordingly ASAP. Thanks and good luck with assignment 3.
