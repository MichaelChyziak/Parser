Parser
======
Hello ENSC 251 classmates. If you wish to use our code feel free (giving proper credit at the top of you files ofcourse). If for some reason you find a test case that the TA's didn't find and that NEEDS to be covered then please let us know on piazza and we will fix the code accordingly ASAP. We are the afternoon lab on tuesday and since we don't have any lab for questions to be asked, feel free to ask them on piazza also.

Cases Failed:
-----
Passes ALL of the cases sent to us for checking (both needed and optional).

How to access the code:
-----
All you need is the "parserClasses.cpp" and "parserClasses.h" file to continue on with assignment 3. In order to copy the code just click one of them and right above the code on the right side should be a button labeled "Raw". Click on that button and then copy and paste the code for use in assignment 3. Good Luck.

Versions:
-----
The version number is located at the top of the file. If a version has beta beside it, it means it is still a work in progress.

1.0 -> Initial Version (no version name at top of files found means it's this version)
1.1 -> COMING SOON...
    -> Fixes where "58." would be split into 2 tokens, but should be 1
    -> Fixes where the append function in parserClasses.cpp with a token as a parameter now works for non-empty lists
